# Dont Care

_The app for indecisive hungry people_

## Goals

- Help me get more familiar with C# and Visual Studio.
- Implement "clean architecture", letting the core of the project power a CLI interface, Android app, and Website as well as store results locally or remotely in JOSN and a SQL database.
- The app itself should let users quickly provide some preferences and present a few options for them (using things like location, food type, price range, and past favorites) to help them easily decide where to eat.
